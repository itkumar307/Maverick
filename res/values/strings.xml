    <!-- introduction for Metabolic Typing Questionnaire -->

    <string name="INTRO_METABOLIC_QUES">This questionnaire is designed to help you
		determine the optimal macronutrient ratio (fats, proteins,
		carbohydrates) to begin the process of fine-tuning your body’s
		feedback mechanisms. For those of you who are not sure what a fat,
		protein, or carbohydrate is, let me simplify that for you. If the food
		comes from something that has a set of eyes, it is going to be higher
		in fats and proteins; fats and proteins most often come together in
		nature. Foods like vegetables, breads and cereals do not come from a
		source that has a set of eyes and are generally much higher in
		carbohydrates and lower in fat and protein. There are a few exceptions
		to this rule, such as nuts and avocados, which have no eyes, yet are
		high fat foods.

		When answering the questions, circle the answer that best describes the
		way you feel, not the way you think you should eat! If none of the
		answers suit you with regard to a particular question, simply don’t
		answer that question. If answer A suits you some of the time (in the
		morning but not the evening for example), and answer B suits you other
		times, you may circle both provided that the answers refer to how you
		may feel on any given day, not within a period of 24 hours.</string>

    <!-- stress management static value -->

    <string name="streesmanagement1">Human beings can go without food for several days; but nobody can go without sleep! Our body keeps
oscillating between a sympathetic and parasympathetic response right through the day. Your sympathetic
response is your ‘fight or flight’ response - the one that makes you stressed and active. Not all stress is
bad! We need a certain amount of stress and drive to keep us growing. But the periods of sympathetic
dominance should be backed by enough periods of parasympathetic response time. Parasympathetic
refers to the ‘rest and recoup’ response of the body.</string>
    <string name="streesmanagement2"> It is the time for the daily routine work of the body -
all your organs do their given jobs. However, if you go for long periods on a sympathetic dominant state,you are denying your body an opportunity to perform its daily routine work.
Your sleeping hours are very important to ensure a healthy body. Your body takes its cues from the sun,
like most living things on this planet. With the morning light, cortisol (the wake-up hormone) levels rise in
the human body and, as the sun goes down, melatonin (the sleep hormone) levels rise. However, today’s
lifestyle prompts many people to go to bed much later into the night. Your body does all physiological
repairs between 10 PM and</string>
    <string name="streesmanagement3">2 AM. From 2 AM to 6 AM is the time for psychological repairs. So, unless you perform meditation
regularly, your body needs to rest from 10 PM to 6 AM to perform all its daily chores. Also, if you ensure
that you perform some kind of meditative exercises or some passive rest periods like listening to music
or painting during each day, you will be giving your body enough time to recoup from the ravages of daily
stress.</string>
    <string name="streesmanagement4">Breathing plays a very important role in ensuring your body gets enough oxygen. During times of stress,
a deep breath will help calm your nerves. Take the effort to learn proper breathing techniques - not just
when you exercise but right through your daily waking hours.
Research shows that your DNA is nothing but potential that can get expressed only through the process
of thinking. So, you should ensure that you always have positive thoughts. Counter any negative thinking
with a positive approach.</string>

    <!-- know your basic -->

    <string name="knowyour1">Physical fitness is to the human body what fine-tuning is to an engine. It enables us to perform up to
our potential. Fitness can be described as a condition that helps us look, feel and do our best. More
specifically, it is:<i>“The ability to perform daily tasks vigorously and alertly, with energy left over for enjoying leisure-time
activities and meeting emergency demands. It is the ability to endure, to bear up, to withstand stress,
to carry on in circumstances where an unfit person could not continue, and is a major basis of good
health and well-being.” </i></string>
    <string name="knowyour2">Physical fitness involves the performance of the heart and lungs, and the muscles of the body. And,
since what we do with our bodies also affects what we can do with our minds, fitness influences to
some degree qualities such as mental alertness and emotional stability. As you undertake your fitness
program, it is important to remember that fitness is an individual quality that varies from person to
person. It is influenced by age, sex, heredity, personal habits, exercise and eating practices. You cannot
do anything about the first three factors; however, it is within your power to change and improve the
others where needed. Physical fitness is most easily understood by examining its components:-</string>
    <string name="knowyour3"><b>Cardio-Respiratory Endurance</b> - the ability to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues and to remove
wastes over sustained periods of time. Long runs and swims are among the methods employed in
measuring this component.<b>Muscular Strength</b> - the ability of a muscle to exert force for a brief period of time. Upper-body strength,
for example, can be measured by various weight- lifting exercises.<b>Muscular Endurance </b>- the ability of a muscle, or a group of muscles, to sustain repeated contractions
or to continue applying force against a fixed object. Pushups are often used to test endurance of arm
and shoulder muscles.</string>
    <string name="knowyour4"><b>Flexibility</b> - the ability to move joints and use muscles through their full range of motion.
The sit-and-reach test is a good measure of flexibility of the lower back and the backs of the
upper legs.<b>Body Composition</b> - is often considered a component of fitness. It refers to the makeup
of the body in terms of lean mass (muscle, bone, vital tissue and organs) and fat mass. An
optimal ratio of fat to lean mass is an indication of fitness, and the right types of exercise will
help you decrease body fat and increase/maintain muscle mass.</string>

    <!-- Why of Warming-up -->
    <string name="warmup1"><b>The Warm-Up and Cool-Down</b>\nBefore you start strength training, do five minutes of any activity that uses the muscles you\'ll be
exercising, such as riding a stationary bike to warm up your legs or rowing for an all-body workout.
Another alternative is to do a few repetitions of the exercises you\’ll be doing later with lighter weights.
Five to ten minutes should be enough to increase the temperature of your muscles, making them more
flexible and less susceptible to injury. If your heart rate goes above 100 beats per minute after you
workout with weights, and you plan to do some floor exercises such as sit-ups and leg lifts, you need a
cool-down to keep from getting dizzy or faint. Walk around or pedal slowly on a stationary bike until your
heart rate slows down. Otherwise, you donot need a cool-down; just go ahead and stretch your muscles.</string>
    <string name="warmup2"><b>Full Warm-Up </b>\nThis usually involves doing some low-intensity cardio work for five to ten minutes until you break a sweat.
It gets blood flowing and prepares the body for work to come. Some light stretching follows, and then a
few light sets of whatever exercises are going to be done. Keep in mind not to do too much or it will affect
your energy levels for the actual workout. This type of warm-up is particularly appropriate for novice,
injured or older trainers, though anyone can use it.</string>
    <string name="warmup3"><b>Light Set Warm-Up </b>\nThis involves doing a number of progressively heavier sets (starting lightly) of the exercise you are about
to do. This prepares the specific muscle group for the work sets. Don\'t do too much here or your work
sets will suffer. These light sets are often done before each new exercise, particularly if you are moving
on to a different body part. If you are doing a different exercise for the same body part, a warm-up for that
exercise is usually not necessary.</string>
    <string name="warmup4">Limited Warm-UpThis type of warm-up is for advanced trainers only. Do a set of ten reps with 50% of the weight that
you are going to be using for that exercise. That\'s it. Your body can be trained to work well with this
type of limited warm-up. If you usually do an extended warm-up, work down to this level slowly. This
method has the advantage of conserving energy for work sets. For exercises where you will be using
low reps and very heavy weights (close to your maximum), you may want to do a low-rep progressive
warm-up. For example, if you are doing deadlifts with 405 pounds, do 5 reps with one plate per side, 2
reps with two plates, 1 rep with three plates, and maybe 1 rep with three and a quarter, if you feel you
need it. This type of pyramid warm-up doesnot exhaust you but still prepares your body for heavy work.
This type of warm-up is used when you go for a one-rep maximum attempt. It conditions your body to
be able to handle sudden physical activity without injury.</string>

    <!-- why maverick -->
    <string name="whymaverick1">Human beings are funny creatures. We know smoking is injurious to health and yet yield to the
temptation. We understand exercising is good for wellness and yet need enormous motivation to be
consistent. Well, it is not surprising for the very word exercise means ‘to exert energy’. With current
lifestyle trends being stressful on various counts, an additional stress called ‘exercise’ does indeed
need enormous external motivation. Looks like we need to redefine our fitness regime from one
of ‘exerting energy’ to one of ‘energizing’ ourselves to be a human dynamo. As you probably know, a
dynamo or an electric generator is where mechanical energy is converted into electric energy. I use
this simile to say the purpose of a fitness program is justified only when the mechanical energy lost in
exercise (or exertion) is converted into ‘electric’ energy here to energize the whole bodily functioning.</string>
    <string name="whymaverick2">Else such exercise will have long term adverse repercussions.\n
What gives humanity energy? Our personal primary source of energy is the food we eat. The very
purpose of eating is to get energy though most often the food we eat drains away our energy. This is
primarily because each individual has a unique biochemistry and need to identify what food actually
provides you with energy. In order to identify your unique energy source in foods, Maverick has
adapted Metabolic typing, a specialized system evolved by William Wolcott and advocated by the
C.H.E.K institute. Our dietitians will help identify your metabolic type and suggest dietary charts that
will energize you.</string>
    <string name="whymaverick3">Another source of energy to the human body is the oxygen we inhale. Recently, scientists have found
the dark side of oxygen - the free radicals that actually are responsible for aging. Proper breathing
techniques have to be adapted not just while you exercise but always to ensure oxygen gives you the
energy it is meant to give. Maverick teaches inhalation-exhalation techniques with every exercise that
is performed.</string>
    <string name="whymaverick4">What is the use of filling a bucket that has a hole in the bottom? Similarly, of what use will the energy
generated be when there is a constant depletion by way of stress? In a mechanical world, by replacing
one defective part, the whole machine will be rectified. But the human body is a holistic system
of compensations. Be it emotional stress, physical stress, digestive stress, lack of sleep, parasite
infection or any other form of disease, the body will simply process it as \‘stress\’. Unless this ‘hole’ at
the bottom of the bucket is sealed, no point filling up the bucket. Maverick helps identify</string>

    <!-- strength basic -->
    <string name="strength1">There are two reasons for the dwindling of strength in a healthy adult. One is the
aging process - the number of muscle cells starts to decline after the age of 30. A
far greater cause of fading vitality is the use-it-or-lose-it principle. However, there
is ample evidence that strength loss is mostly reversible. Experts recommend that
adults have at least two strength workouts each week, in addition to three sessions
of aerobic exercise. You can restore loss of muscle function at almost any age by
starting a strength-training program.</string>
    <string name="strength2">Whatever muscle may be left at age 80 is just as responsive as it was at age 20. You just need to be
sure that there is some left. No workout program would be complete without strength training. Although
you need to do aerobics to keep your heart and lungs in good working order, you need to do resistance
training to maintain your muscular strength and endurance, boost your metabolism and strengthen your
bones.</string>
    <string name="strength3">Maverick trainers will help you determine how much and how often to lift. In general, if you can\'t maintain
good form for at least eight repetitions while lifting a weight, it\'s too heavy; and, if you can perform more
than 12, it\'s too light. Schedule two to three strength training sessions a week, allowing a rest day in
between sessions to give your muscles time to repair and recover. If you want to lift weights every day,
work out your upper body (arms, shoulders and upper back) one day and your lower body (calves,
gluteus muscles, hamstrings, quadriceps) the next.</string>
    <string name="strength4">ifting weights can lift your spirits. A recent study found that strength training improved moods in people
suffering from depression. It also seemed to help them sleep better. Other studies show that people
tend to become more physically active once they start weight training; perhaps because their increased
strength makes other activities easier to do and more enjoyable.
It takes 3500 Kcal to burn one pound of fat and only 580 Kcal to burn one pound of muscle. So, if you
starve your body without enough nutrition and do heavy cardio workouts alone, you are burning muscle
tissue instead of fat. When the body feels threatened in such a manner, it will burn healthy tissue and
store fat. This is why muscle training is the most important component of your fitness regime.</string>
