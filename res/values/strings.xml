	<!-- introduction for Metabolic Typing Questionnaire -->

	<string name="INTRO_METABOLIC_QUES">This questionnaire is designed to help you
		determine the optimal macronutrient ratio (fats, proteins,
		carbohydrates) to begin the process of fine-tuning your body’s
		feedback mechanisms. For those of you who are not sure what a fat,
		protein, or carbohydrate is, let me simplify that for you. If the food
		comes from something that has a set of eyes, it is going to be higher
		in fats and proteins; fats and proteins most often come together in
		nature. Foods like vegetables, breads and cereals do not come from a
		source that has a set of eyes and are generally much higher in
		carbohydrates and lower in fat and protein. There are a few exceptions
		to this rule, such as nuts and avocados, which have no eyes, yet are
		high fat foods.

		When answering the questions, circle the answer that
		best describes the
		way you feel, not the way you think you should eat!
		If none of the
		answers suit you with regard to a particular question,
		simply don’t
		answer that question. If answer A suits you some of the
		time (in the
		morning but not the evening for example), and answer B
		suits you other
		times, you may circle both provided that the answers
		refer to how you
		may feel on any given day, not within a period of 24
		hours.

	<!-- introduction for workin Typing Questionnaire -->
	<string name="INTRO_WORKIN_QUES">Life is paradox! On the one

		hand \'Movement is
		life!\'
		So

		exercising is important.

		But equally true, the body

		will
		process every
		stimuli

		from the outer world only

		as a chemical process. So

		it is
		important to give

		time to the body to \'Rest

		and recoup\' from the

		ravages
		of the day. That is

		why in Maverick we insist

		on working IN as
		much as

		working OUT.

		The very word exercise

		means to exert energy. You

		can exert
		energy only if

		you have energy. So if

		working out is a way of

		exercising, working in is a

		method of energy builiding.

		Please take the

		learn the Zone exercises

		recommended for you. These

		are available
		both in

		pictorial cards as well as

		videos on the touchscreen.

		All
		Maverick trainers are

		equipped to teach you these

		exercises.

		When do you
		work in and when

	<!-- stress management static value -->

	<string name="streesmanagement1">Human beings can go without food for several days;
		but nobody can go without sleep! Our body keeps
		oscillating between a
		sympathetic and parasympathetic response right through the
		day. Your
		sympathetic
		response is your ‘fight or flight’ response - the one that
		makes you stressed
		and active. Not all stress is
		bad! We need a certain
		amount of stress and drive to keep us growing. But
		the periods of
		sympathetic
		dominance should be backed by enough periods of
		parasympathetic response time.
		Parasympathetic
		refers to the ‘rest and
		recoup’ response of the body.
	</string>
	<string name="streesmanagement2"> It is the time for the daily routine work of the
		body -
		all your organs do their given jobs. However, if you go for long
		periods
		on a sympathetic dominant state,you are denying your body an
		opportunity to perform its daily routine work.
		Your sleeping hours are
		very important to ensure a healthy body. Your body
		takes its cues from
		the sun,
		like most living things on this planet. With the morning
		light, cortisol
		(the wake-up hormone) levels rise in
		the human body and,
		as the sun goes down, melatonin (the sleep hormone)
		levels rise.
		However, today’s
		lifestyle prompts many people to go to bed much later
		into the night. Your body
		does all physiological
		repairs between 10 PM
		and
	</string>
	<string name="streesmanagement3">2 AM. From 2 AM to 6 AM is the time for
		psychological repairs. So, unless you perform meditation
		regularly,
		your body needs to rest from 10 PM to 6 AM to perform all its daily
		chores. Also, if you ensure
		that you perform some kind of meditative
		exercises or some passive rest
		periods like listening to music
		or
		painting during each day, you will be giving your body enough time to
		recoup from the ravages of daily
		stress.
	</string>
	<string name="streesmanagement4">Breathing plays a very important role in ensuring
		your body gets enough oxygen. During times of stress,
		a deep breath
		will help calm your nerves. Take the effort to learn
		proper breathing
		techniques - not just
		when you exercise but right through your daily
		waking hours.
		Research shows that your DNA is nothing but potential
		that can get expressed
		only through the process
		of thinking. So, you
		should ensure that you always have positive
		thoughts. Counter any
		negative thinking
		with a positive approach.

	<!-- know your basic -->

	<string name="knowyour1">
		Physical fitness is to the human body what fine-tuning is to an
		engine. It enables us to perform up to
		our potential. Fitness can be
		described as a condition that helps us
		look, feel and do our best. More
		specifically, it is:
		<i>“The ability to perform daily tasks vigorously and alertly, with
			energy left over for enjoying leisure-time
			activities and meeting
			emergency demands. It is the ability to endure, to bear
			up, to
			withstand stress,
			to carry on in circumstances where an unfit person
			could not continue,
			and is a major basis of good
			health and
			well-being.”
		</i>
	</string>
	<string name="knowyour2">Physical fitness involves the performance of the
		heart and lungs, and the muscles of the body. And,
		since what we do
		with our bodies also affects what we can do with our
		minds, fitness
		influences to
		some degree qualities such as mental alertness and
		emotional stability. As
		you undertake your fitness
		program, it is
		important to remember that fitness is an individual quality
		that varies
		from person to
		person. It is influenced by age, sex, heredity, personal
		habits, exercise and
		eating practices. You cannot
		do anything about the
		first three factors; however, it is within your
		power to change and
		improve the
		others where needed. Physical fitness is most easily
		understood by examining
		its components:-
	</string>
	<string name="knowyour3">
		<b>Cardio-Respiratory Endurance</b>
		- the ability to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues and to remove
		wastes over sustained periods of time. Long runs and swims are among
		the methods employed in
		measuring this component.
		<b>Muscular Strength</b>
		- the ability of a muscle to exert force for a brief period of time.
		Upper-body strength,
		for example, can be measured by various weight-
		lifting exercises.
		<b>Muscular Endurance </b>
		- the ability of a muscle, or a group of muscles, to sustain repeated
		contractions
		or to continue applying force against a fixed object.
		Pushups are often
		used to test endurance of arm
		and shoulder muscles.
	</string>
	<string name="knowyour4">
		<b>Flexibility</b>
		- the ability to move joints and use muscles through their full range
		of motion.
		The sit-and-reach test is a good measure of flexibility of
		the lower back
		and the backs of the
		upper legs.
		<b>Body Composition</b>
		- is often considered a component of fitness. It refers to the makeup
		of the body in terms of lean mass (muscle, bone, vital tissue and
		organs) and fat mass. An
		optimal ratio of fat to lean mass is an
		indication of fitness, and the right
		types of exercise will
		help you
		decrease body fat and increase/maintain muscle mass.
	</string>

	<!-- Why of Warming-up -->
	<string name="warmup1">
		<b>The Warm-Up and Cool-Down</b>
		\nBefore you start strength training, do five minutes of any activity
		that uses the muscles you\'ll be
		exercising, such as riding a
		stationary bike to warm up your legs or rowing for
		an all-body workout.
		Another alternative is to do a few repetitions of the exercises
		you\’ll be
		doing later with lighter weights.
		Five to ten minutes should
		be enough to increase the temperature of your
		muscles, making them more
		flexible and less susceptible to injury. If your heart rate goes above
		100
		beats per minute after you
		workout with weights, and you plan to do
		some floor exercises such as sit-ups
		and leg lifts, you need a
		cool-down to keep from getting dizzy or faint. Walk around or pedal
		slowly on a
		stationary bike until your
		heart rate slows down. Otherwise,
		you donot need a cool-down; just go ahead
		and stretch your muscles.
	</string>
	<string name="warmup2">
		<b>Full Warm-Up </b>
		\nThis usually involves doing some low-intensity cardio work for five
		to ten minutes until you break a sweat.
		It gets blood flowing and
		prepares the body for work to come. Some light
		stretching follows, and
		then a
		few light sets of whatever exercises are going to be done. Keep
		in mind
		not to do too much or it will affect
		your energy levels for the
		actual workout. This type of warm-up is
		particularly appropriate for
		novice,
		injured or older trainers, though anyone can use it.
	</string>
	<string name="warmup3">
		<b>Light Set Warm-Up </b>
		\nThis involves doing a number of progressively heavier sets (starting
		lightly) of the exercise you are about
		to do. This prepares the
		specific muscle group for the work sets. Don\'t
		do too much here or
		your work
		sets will suffer. These light sets are often done before each
		new
		exercise, particularly if you are moving
		on to a different body
		part. If you are doing a different exercise for
		the same body part, a
		warm-up for that
		exercise is usually not necessary.
	</string>
	<string name="warmup4">Limited Warm-UpThis type of warm-up is for advanced
		trainers only. Do a set of ten reps with 50% of the weight that
		you are
		going to be using for that exercise. That\'s it. Your body can be
		trained to work well with this
		type of limited warm-up. If you usually
		do an extended warm-up, work down
		to this level slowly. This
		method has
		the advantage of conserving energy for work sets. For exercises
		where
		you will be using
		low reps and very heavy weights (close to your
		maximum), you may want to
		do a low-rep progressive
		warm-up. For example,
		if you are doing deadlifts with 405 pounds, do 5 reps
		with one plate
		per side, 2
		reps with two plates, 1 rep with three plates, and maybe 1
		rep with three
		and a quarter, if you feel you
		need it. This type of
		pyramid warm-up doesnot exhaust you but still
		prepares your body for
		heavy work.
		This type of warm-up is used when you go for a one-rep
		maximum attempt. It
		conditions your body to
		be able to handle sudden
		physical activity without injury.

	<!-- why maverick -->
	<string name="whymaverick1">Human beings are funny creatures. We know smoking
		is injurious to health and yet yield to the
		temptation. We understand
		exercising is good for wellness and yet need enormous
		motivation to be
		consistent. Well, it is not surprising for the very word exercise
		means ‘to exert
		energy’. With current
		lifestyle trends being stressful
		on various counts, an additional stress called
		‘exercise’ does indeed
		need enormous external motivation. Looks like we need to redefine our
		fitness regime from one
		of ‘exerting energy’ to one of ‘energizing’
		ourselves to be a human
		dynamo. As you probably know, a
		dynamo or an
		electric generator is where mechanical energy is converted into
		electric energy. I use
		this simile to say the purpose of a fitness
		program is justified only when
		the mechanical energy lost in
		exercise
		(or exertion) is converted into ‘electric’ energy here to energize
		the
		whole bodily functioning.
	</string>
	<string name="whymaverick2">Else such exercise will have long term adverse
		repercussions.\n
		What gives humanity energy? Our personal primary
		source of energy is the
		food we eat. The very
		purpose of eating is to
		get energy though most often the food we eat drains
		away our energy.
		This is
		primarily because each individual has a unique biochemistry and
		need to
		identify what food actually
		provides you with energy. In order
		to identify your unique energy source in
		foods, Maverick has
		adapted
		Metabolic typing, a specialized system evolved by William Wolcott and
		advocated by the
		C.H.E.K institute. Our dietitians will help identify
		your metabolic type and
		suggest dietary charts that
		will energize you.
	</string>
	<string name="whymaverick3">Another source of energy to the human body is the
		oxygen we inhale. Recently, scientists have found
		the dark side of
		oxygen - the free radicals that actually are responsible
		for aging.
		Proper breathing
		techniques have to be adapted not just while you
		exercise but always to ensure
		oxygen gives you the
		energy it is meant to
		give. Maverick teaches inhalation-exhalation
		techniques with every
		exercise that
		is performed.
	</string>
	<string name="whymaverick4">What is the use of filling a bucket that has a hole
		in the bottom? Similarly, of what use will the energy
		generated be when
		there is a constant depletion by way of stress? In a
		mechanical world,
		by replacing
		one defective part, the whole machine will be rectified.
		But the human
		body is a holistic system
		of compensations. Be it
		emotional stress, physical stress, digestive
		stress, lack of sleep,
		parasite
		infection or any other form of disease, the body will simply
		process it as
		\‘stress\’. Unless this ‘hole’ at
		the bottom of the bucket

	<!-- strength basic -->
	<string name="strength1">There are two reasons for the dwindling of strength
		in a healthy adult. One is the
		aging process - the number of muscle
		cells starts to decline after the age
		of 30. A
		far greater cause of
		fading vitality is the use-it-or-lose-it principle.
		However, there
		is
		ample evidence that strength loss is mostly reversible. Experts
		recommend that
		adults have at least two strength workouts each week, in
		addition to three
		sessions
		of aerobic exercise. You can restore loss of
		muscle function at almost
		any age by
		starting a strength-training
		program.
	</string>
	<string name="strength2">Whatever muscle may be left at age 80 is just as
		responsive as it was at age 20. You just need to be
		sure that there is
		some left. No workout program would be complete without
		strength
		training. Although
		you need to do aerobics to keep your heart and lungs
		in good working
		order, you need to do resistance
		training to maintain
		your muscular strength and endurance, boost your
		metabolism and
		strengthen your
		bones.
	</string>
	<string name="strength3">Maverick trainers will help you determine how much
		and how often to lift. In general, if you can\'t maintain
		good form for
		at least eight repetitions while lifting a weight, it\'s too
		heavy;
		and, if you can perform more
		than 12, it\'s too light. Schedule two to
		three strength training sessions
		a week, allowing a rest day in
		between
		sessions to give your muscles time to repair and recover. If you want
		to lift weights every day,
		work out your upper body (arms, shoulders
		and upper back) one day and your
		lower body (calves,
		gluteus muscles,
		hamstrings, quadriceps) the next.
	</string>
	<string name="strength4">ifting weights can lift your spirits. A recent
		study found that strength training improved moods in people
		suffering
		from depression. It also seemed to help them sleep better. Other
		studies show that people
		tend to become more physically active once
		they start weight training;
		perhaps because their increased
		strength
		makes other activities easier to do and more enjoyable.
		It takes 3500
		Kcal to burn one pound of fat and only 580 Kcal to burn
		one pound of
		muscle. So, if you
		starve your body without enough nutrition and do
		heavy cardio workouts
		alone, you are burning muscle
		tissue instead of
		fat. When the body feels threatened in such a manner, it
		will burn
		healthy tissue and
		store fat. This is why muscle training is the most
		important component of
		your fitness regime.
