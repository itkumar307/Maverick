	<!-- introduction for Metabolic Typing Questionnaire -->
	
	<string name="INTRO_METABOLIC_QUES">This questionnaire is designed to help you
		determine the optimal macronutrient ratio (fats, proteins,
		carbohydrates) to begin the process of fine-tuning your body’s
		feedback mechanisms. For those of you who are not sure what a fat,
		protein, or carbohydrate is, let me simplify that for you. If the food
		comes from something that has a set of eyes, it is going to be higher
		in fats and proteins; fats and proteins most often come together in
		nature. Foods like vegetables, breads and cereals do not come from a
		source that has a set of eyes and are generally much higher in
		carbohydrates and lower in fat and protein. There are a few exceptions
		to this rule, such as nuts and avocados, which have no eyes, yet are
		high fat foods.

		When answering the questions, circle the answer that best describes the
		way you feel, not the way you think you should eat! If none of the
		answers suit you with regard to a particular question, simply don’t
		answer that question. If answer A suits you some of the time (in the
		morning but not the evening for example), and answer B suits you other
		times, you may circle both provided that the answers refer to how you
		may feel on any given day, not within a period of 24 hours.
